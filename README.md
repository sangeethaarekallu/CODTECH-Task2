  Objective of the program:  
  The objective of the code is to create a simple student grade management system. The system allows users to:  
  . Add students  
  . Add grades for each student (with subject and grade value)    
  . Display all grades for all students, including the average grade for each student   
and aim of the code is to imporve skills on   
. Python programming  
. Data structures (dictionaries, lists)   
. Control structures (if-else, loops)   
. Functions and modularity   
. User interface design (text-based menu)   
Key activity:  
1. Add student: Adds a new student to the system.  
2. Add grade: Adds a grade for a specific student.  
3. Calculate average grade: Calculates the average grade for each student.   
4. Display grades: Displays all grades for all students, including the average grade.  
 Activities are the core functions of the code, and they work together to create a simple student grade management system.
Technology used:
Python:
In the code i used python programming concepts and data structures to create a student grade management system.
